# spa-react-liferay-dxp-headless

A very simple example of React with Liferay DXP Headless API

- demo.html is a react spa without JSX getting a content already rendered from liferay and only displaying it in react.
- demo2.html is a react spa with JSX (using babel) getting a content not rendered yet (only structured content) from liferay and rendering it in react.
- demo3.html (plus) an example of filtering structured-contents by keywords
